# UniFiles
UniFiles is a personal filehost I made to test out the UniGui framework. It is very basic and not powerful at all.

## How to use?
Just extract the .exe and the and the "neededfiles" folder that came with it to a folder and start the exe.
You can connect to it using ```localhost:8077```

## How do I change some server settings like the port?
After the server has been started it would generate a "config.ini" file. There you can edit the server settings.
Note: Modifying the server settings requiers the server to be restarted.
